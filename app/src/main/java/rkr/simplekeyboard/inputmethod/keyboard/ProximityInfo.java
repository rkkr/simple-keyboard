/* HOW WE PRE-SELECT THE CELLS (iterate over only the relevant cells, instead of all of them)

  We want to compute the distance for keys that are in the cells that are close enough to the
  key border, as this method is performance-critical. These keys are represented with 'star'
  background on the diagram below. Let's consider the Y case first.

  We want to select the cells which center falls between the top of the key minus the threshold,
  and the bottom of the key plus the threshold.
  topPixelWithinThreshold is key.mY - threshold, and bottomPixelWithinThreshold is
  key.mY + key.mHeight + threshold.

  Then we need to compute the center of the top row that we need to evaluate, as we'll iterate
  from there.

  |---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---|          | the center of the cell, we only need
  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |          | to compute for these cells where
  '---'---'---'---'---'---'---'---'---'---'---'          | topPixelWithinThreshold is above the
                                        (positive x,y)   | center of the cell. This is the case
                                                         | when yDeltaToGrid is less than half

  |       |       |       |       |       |              | On the zoomed in diagram, on the right
  |       |       |       |       |       |              | the topPixelWithinThreshold (represented
  |       |       |       |       |       |      top of  | with an = sign) is below and we can skip
  +-------+-------+-------+--v----+-------+ .. top cell  | this cell, while on the left it's above
  |       | = topPixelWT  |  |  yDeltaToGrid             | and we need to compute for this cell.
  |..yStart.|.....|.......|..|....|.......|... y middle  | Thus, if yDeltaToGrid is more than half
  |   (left)|     |       |  ^ =  |       | of top cell  | the height of the cell, we start the
  +-------+-|-----+-------+----|--+-------+              | iteration one cell below the top cell,
  |       | |     |       |    |  |       |              | else we start it on the top cell. This
  |.......|.|.....|.......|....|..|.....yStart (right)   | is stored in yStart.

  Since we only want to go up to bottomPixelWithinThreshold, and we only iterate on the center
  of the keys, we can stop as soon as the y value exceeds bottomPixelThreshold, so we don't
  have to align this on the center of the key. Hence, we don't need a separate value for
  bottomPixelWithinThreshold and call this yEnd right away.
